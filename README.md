# Phonewords

**Phonewords** are [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) phrases represented as [alphanumeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric) equivalents of a [telephone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number). In many countries, the digits on the [telephone keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad) also have letters assigned. By replacing the digits of a telephone number with the corresponding letters, it is sometimes possible to form a whole or partial word, an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym), abbreviation, or some other alphanumeric combination.
